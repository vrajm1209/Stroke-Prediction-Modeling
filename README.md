# Stroke-Prediction-Modeling

Problem Statement & Importance

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. It is another health issue that has found to be rising throughout the world due to the adoption of lifestyle changes that disregards healthy lifestyle & good eating habits. Thus, new emerging electronic devices that record the health vitals have paved the way for creating an automated solution with AI techniques at its core. Similar to heart diseases, efforts have begun to create lab tests that predict stroke. The dataset presented here has many factors that highlight the lifestyle of the patients and hence gives us an opportunity to create an AI-based solution for it.
It is said that 80% of heart strokes are preventable. With such a high possibility of prevention, accurately predicting if a person is at the threat of having a stroke could be crucial for health science. The available necessary data is another motivation to proceed with this problem.

Solution

We aim to build a stroke prediction model. For this we try out 3 different algorithms & carry out hyper parameter tuning for each to come up with the best possible model. This dataset can be found on Kaggle.

There are a number of steps we follow & describe along the way - all this can be found in our notebook that has been submitted.
